keyelf This Python script is specifically designed for recovering Bitcoin private keys from corrupted or accidentally deleted data sources.
It doesn't rely on a complete file structure, but instead locates private keys by directly scanning the raw binary data.

1. Core Principle:
The tool locates potential private keys by searching for a specific Bitcoin private key signature (ASN.1 structure prefix) within the data stream. 
Once found, it extracts the subsequent 32-byte raw key and automatically converts it to both the standard WIF (Wallet Import Format) compressed and uncompressed formats for direct import into a wallet.

2. Key Features:
Multi-mode Scanning:
Supports scanning single files (such as wallet.dat), entire file directories, and block devices (such as hard drive partitions /dev/sdb or disk images).

3. Highly Reliable Architecture: 
Utilizes a "manager-worker" model when scanning directories.
Each file is handled by a separate child process. Even if a file causes the scan to crash, the main process continues running, ensuring the integrity of the scan.

4. High-Performance I/O: 
Prefers using mmap for file memory mapping to improve scanning speed, and automatically falls back to traditional block-based reading.
For large file scans, a built-in progress bar and boundary overlap detection are included to prevent missed files.

5. Ready-to-use output:
Displays found WIF formatted private keys directly in the console and backs up all raw hexadecimal private keys to found_hex_keys.txt.


# To run the script, simply use the following command (replace [target path] with the file, directory, or device you want to scan):

1. Scan a folder
```
python3 keyelf.py /path/to/your/wallets_folder/
```
2. Scan a single file
```
python3 keyelf.py wallet.dat
```
3. Scan an entire hard drive partition (usually requires administrator privileges)
```
sudo python3 keyelf.py /dev/sdb1
```

# For example, a test to find the BTC private key in a deleted wallet file from the hard drive.
```
sudo python3 keyelf.py /dev/sde1
